NAME
    pktgen - Send and receive multicast packets

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - cmake macro 'FindLibHamcast.cmake'
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - HAMcast library and middleware

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast to standard directories, run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    This will initialize build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    If build was successful you find the binary in 'build' folder.

Install
    Currently not supported. Just run pktgen from build directory.

SYNOPSIS
    pktgen [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION

    The program can send and receive multicast packets using HAMcast or
    standard IP multicast. It was written to perform delay measurements.

EXIT STATUS

    pktgen exits with status 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) if send or receive was
    successful with respect to given options, otherwise 1 (EXIT_FAILURE)
    is returned.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
            Print this help screen.

    -i, --interval TIME
            Set packet interval TIME, in msec (1000)

    -n, --network-interface ID
            Set interface ID, default is 0 = ALL

    -m, --mode MODE
            Set multicast MODE: hamcast or ip (hamcast)

    -o, --offset OFFSET
            Set OFFSET to generate packet hash id from (70).

    -l, --length LENGTH
            Set offset LENGTH to generate packet hash id from (50).

    -p, --payload SIZE
            Set packet payload SIZE in Bytes (100)

    -r, --recv GROUP
            Receive from multicast GROUP.

    -s, --send GROUP
            Send to multicast GROUP.

    -t, --time RUNTIME
            Set RUNTIME of experiment, in sec (60)

EXAMPLES
    Receiver:   ./pktgen -r ip://239.238.237.236:1234

    Sender:     ./pktgen -s ip://239.1.2.3:7890 -p 1000 -t 30

FILES
    No other files required or used.

ENVIRONMENT
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set if libhamcast is not installed into
    standard directories, e.g. /usr/lib.

NOTES
    You MUST provide either option '-r' or '-s' with a valid multicast
    group URI. On send and receive strictly ensure that: OFFSET < PAYLOAD
    and LENGTH < OFFSET!
