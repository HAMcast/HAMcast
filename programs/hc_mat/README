NAME
    hc_mat - HAMcast Multicast Address Translator

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - cmake macro 'FindLibHamcast.cmake'
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - HAMcast library and middleware

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast to standard directories, run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    This will initialize build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    If build was successful you find the binary in 'build' folder.

Install
    Currently not supported. Just run img from build directory.

SYNOPSIS
    hc_mat [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION

    The program forwards multicast data between distinct HAMcast
    interfaces. Moreover, it allows to translate an incoming group
    message on the upstream to be forwarded to another outgoing
    group on the downstream interface with a different URI.

EXIT STATUS

    hc_mat exits with status 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) if no errors occure,
    otherwise 1 (EXIT_FAILURE) is returned.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
            Print this help screen.

    -l, --list
            List all interfaces.

    -i, --input-group GROUP
            Set multicast input GROUP URI.

    -o, --output-group GROUP
            Set multicast output GROUP URI.

    -u, --upstream IF
            Set upstream interface id IF.

    -d, --downstream IF
            Set downstream interface id IF.

EXAMPLES
    ./hc_mat -i ip://239.1.2.3:4567 -o ip://239.9.8.7:6543 -d 1 -u 2

ENVIRONMENT
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set if libhamcast is not installed into
    standard directories, e.g. /usr/lib.
