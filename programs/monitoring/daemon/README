NAME
    mdaemon - monitoring daemon to retrieve node information

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - cmake macro 'FindLibHamcast.cmake'
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - HAMcast library and middleware

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast to standard directories, run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    This will initialize build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    If build was successful you find the binary in 'build' folder.

Install
    Currently not supported. Just run pktgen from build directory.
