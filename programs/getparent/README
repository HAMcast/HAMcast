NAME
    hc_status - Show status information for HAMcast middleware

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - cmake macro 'FindLibHamcast.cmake'
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - HAMcast library and middleware

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast to standard directories, run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    This will initialize the build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    If build was successful you find the binary in 'build' folder.

Install
    Currently not supported. Just run hc_status from build directory.

SYNOPSIS
    hc_status [GROUPS]...

DESCRIPTION

    The program provides information on HAMcast middleware and
    multicast status of a node.

EXIT STATUS

    hc_status exits with status 0 (EXIT_SUCCESS) if no error occurs,
    otherwise 1 (EXIT_FAILURE) is returned.

OPTIONS
    None

EXAMPLES
    Without args:   ./hc_status
    With args:      ./hc_status ip://239.238.237.236:1234 ip://239.1.2.3:7890

FILES
    No other files required or used.

NOTES
    If started without arguments hc_status prints current status of
    middleware and multicast group association. If valid group URIs are
    passed hc_status will 'join' these groups, print status infos and
    'leave' groups before program stops.

ENVIRONMENT
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set if libhamcast is not installed into
    standard directories, e.g. /usr/lib.
