\section{Get it}
\label{sec:get}

To create apps for iOS you need Xcode, which brings along other useful development tools and a simulator for iPad and iPhone. Xcode is an IDE from Apple and can be downloaded from the App Store. The tools used for iOS developement must be downloaded via the components tab in the Xcode preferences.

You will also need to download the hamcast framework itself. Since the hamcast framework uses boost~\footnote{http://www.boost.org/}, you will need the boost.framework as well. We used a sleightly modified script created by Alex Kremer~\footnote{http://alex.tapmania.org/2011/11/boost-as-framework-on-ios.html}. These frameworks can be downloaded together from the hamcast website~\footnote{http://hamcast.realmv6.org/developers/wiki/download}.

Now you have everything you need: Xcode, hamcast.framework and boost.framework!
