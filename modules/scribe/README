NAME
    libscribemodule - HAMcast scribe overlay multicast module

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - openssl libraries developers edition
    - libchimera

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast and libchimera to standard directories,
    run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-hamcast-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> \
              -DCHIMERA_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-chimera-headers> \
              -DCHIMERA_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libchimera> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    This will initialize build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    afterwards. If build was successful you find the library in build folder.
