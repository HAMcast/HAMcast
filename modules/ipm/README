NAME
    libipmodule - HAMcast IP multicast module

BUILD/INSTALL

Requirements
    - cmake (Version 2.6+)
    - boost libraries developers edition
    - pcap libraries developers edition (optional)

Build
    We recommend an 'out-of-source' cmake-build. Create a new folder, e.g.
    'build' within the source directory. Change to new folder (cd build)
    and run:

        cmake ../

    if you have not install libhamcast to standard directories, run:

        cmake -DHAMCAST_INCLUDE_PATH=<path-to-headers> \
              -DHAMCAST_LIBRARY_PATH=<path-to-libhamcast> ../

    'path-to-headers' is the absolute path where 'hamcast/hamcast.hpp' can
    be found. 'path-to-libhamcast' is the absolute path where 'libhamcast.so'
    can be found. If both are the same, you have to provide only one of them.
    Optionally you can enable a dynamic service discovery, it will discover
    all multicast enabled network interfaces and will initialize an IP module
    instance for each, to do so pass '-DENABLE_DISCOVERY=true' to cmake.
    If unsure, do nothing ...
    This will initialize build environment, if no errors occure run:

        make

    afterwards. If build was successful you find the library in build folder.
